Information about me

Who are you? What is your life all about?

	I'm David and life is all about the win condition.

What is a day in the life look like?
	Always seeking the opportunities to better myself and my skillsets.

If you had all the time and money you needed, what would you do with your life?
	I'd have a big house with a big gate in a big residential area. I would
hire tons of honest anyones to do the housework and yardwork, while paying them whatever amount that would
make their lives as good as mine.

What are a few of your favorite things?
	Disassembling and tinkering with software, such as pushing the limits within those virtual
realities. I am also eager to learn chess. I suck at it, honestly.
